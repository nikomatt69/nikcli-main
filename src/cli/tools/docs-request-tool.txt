# Docs Request Tools Documentation

## Purpose
Allow agents to request documentation and report gaps for continuous improvement.

## Tools
- docsRequestTool: fetch and suggest docs (local/cloud)
- docsGapReportTool: report missing concepts and impact

## Usage
```ts
await aiDocsTools.request.execute({ concept: 'Vite config', context: 'optimize build' })
```

## Best Practices
- Provide clear concept and context for better matches
- Use gap reports for recurring unknowns
