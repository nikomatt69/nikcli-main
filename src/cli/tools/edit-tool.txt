# Edit Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Perform targeted text replacements with diff preview, validation, and backups.

## Capabilities
- Replace first or all occurrences
- Diff preview via DiffViewer
- Optional syntax validation (JSON/TS/YAML)
- Backup and atomic write

## Usage
```ts
const res = await editTool.execute({
  filePath: 'src/app.ts',
  oldString: 'foo',
  newString: 'bar',
  replaceAll: true,
  createBackup: true,
  validateSyntax: true,
})
```

## Best Practices
- Enable backups for important files
- Validate syntax for code/config files

## Enterprise Guidance (Write Operations)
- Cognitive preflight classifies risk for write and shows reasons (e.g., touching env files, .git, large batches).
- Approval is required for medium+ risk; offer "Approve for session (tool+opType)".
- Always present a diff preview when possible; never write without path sanitization and validation.
