# Coinbase AgentKit Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Expose onchain operations via Coinbase AgentKit (wallet info, transfers, chat).

## Capabilities
- Wallet status and balances
- Transfers and interactions (subject to configuration)
- Chat-like helper for workflows

## Usage
```ts
await coinbaseAgentKitTool.execute('status')
await coinbaseAgentKitTool.execute('transfer', { to: '0x...', amount: '0.01' })
```

## Best Practices
- Use testnets for automation
- Never embed secrets; use env/secure storage
