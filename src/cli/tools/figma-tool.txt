# Figma Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Integrate with Figma API and desktop for exports, codegen, and tokens.

## Best Practices
- Respect API rate limits
- Use exports/codegen on selected nodes

## Enterprise Guidance (Network/Read/Write Operations)
- Exports/codegen: network read; low/medium risk.
- Desktop automation and token extraction: read; approval not required.
- Any write-like or upload operations should request approval per policy; session approval optional.
