# Run Command Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Execute system commands with allow-listing and safety checks (legacy; prefer SecureCommandTool/BashTool).

## Capabilities
- Command allow-listing
- Timeout and environment control
- Basic output capture

## Usage
```ts
const res = await runCommandTool.execute({ command: 'npm test', timeout: 120000 })
```

## Best Practices
- Prefer `secureTools.executeCommand(...)` for audited execution
- Avoid dangerous commands; keep to read-only where possible
