# Git Tools Documentation

## Purpose
Safe Git operations: status, diff, commit, applyPatch (no push).

## Best Practices
- Review diffs before commit/apply
- Avoid destructive commands (push/reset) in this tool scope

## Enterprise Guidance (Mixed Operations)
- status/diff: operationType=read; no approval.
- commit/applyPatch: operationType=write; preflight and approval for medium+ risk; session approval optional.
