# Snapshot Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Create and manage workspace snapshots for backup and restore workflows.

## Best Practices
- Prefer quick snapshots during iterations; full for releases
- Always restore with backup enabled

## Enterprise Guidance (Mixed Operations)
- create/list/compare: read/network as applicable; low/medium risk.
- restore/delete: write/delete operations; preflight + approval; session approval optional.
