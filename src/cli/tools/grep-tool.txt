# Grep Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Advanced search across files with ignore patterns, context lines, and performance safeguards.

## Capabilities
- Search by string or regex with case/word options
- Context lines before/after matches
- Smart ignore (node_modules, dist, .git, etc.)
- Size limits and binary detection
- Detailed results with file, line, column

## Usage
```ts
const result = await grepTool.execute({
  pattern: 'TODO',
  path: 'src',
  include: '*.{ts,tsx}',
  caseSensitive: false,
  contextLines: 2,
})
```

## Best Practices
- Narrow by include patterns to improve performance
- Use context lines for code review-friendly results

## Enterprise Guidance (Read Operations)
- Preflight annotates operationType=read and lists paths scanned; generally no approval.
- Escalate only if policies flag scope (e.g., outside workspace roots).
