# Find Files Tool Documentation

## Purpose
Globby-powered file discovery using glob patterns within the working directory.

## Capabilities
- Glob patterns with cwd control
- Only files (excludes directories)
- Optional UI display of results

## Usage
```ts
const files = await findFilesTool.execute('src/**/*.test.ts', { cwd: process.cwd() })
```

## Best Practices
- Combine with grep or multi-read for analysis pipelines
- Keep globs specific to reduce overhead

## Enterprise Guidance (Read Operations)
- Preflight annotates operationType=read; no approval by default.
- Avoid globbing outside workspace; escalate only on policy triggers.
