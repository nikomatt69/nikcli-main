## What is NikCLI?

NikCLI is a **next-generation AI-powered development assistant** that combines the power of artificial intelligence with practical development tools. Unlike traditional CLI tools, NikCLI features **cognitive orchestration** - an advanced system that understands natural language tasks, breaks them down intelligently, and executes them using the most appropriate strategies.

### Core Philosophy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cognitive Understanding">
    NikCLI uses advanced NLP to understand your intent, extract entities, and assess task complexity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intelligent Planning">
    Creates orchestration plans with optimal strategies (sequential, parallel, hybrid, adaptive)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adaptive Execution">
    Executes tasks with real-time supervision and automatic fallback strategies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Learning">
    Learns from each interaction to improve future task execution and planning
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

### üß† **Cognitive Orchestration System**

NikCLI's Universal Agent features a sophisticated cognitive system that:

- **Parses natural language** with 90%+ accuracy using advanced NLP
- **Extracts entities** (files, components, APIs, databases) from task descriptions
- **Assesses complexity** and selects optimal execution strategies
- **Learns patterns** from previous tasks to improve future performance

```typescript
// Example: Cognitive Task Understanding
const cognition = await agent.parseTaskWithCognition(
  "Create a React authentication component with TypeScript and Jest tests"
);

// Result: {
//   intent: { primary: 'create', confidence: 0.9, complexity: 'high' },
//   entities: [
//     { type: 'component', name: 'authentication', confidence: 0.9 },
//     { type: 'file', name: 'component.tsx', confidence: 0.8 }
//   ],
//   requiredCapabilities: ['react', 'typescript', 'testing'],
//   estimatedComplexity: 7
// }
```
