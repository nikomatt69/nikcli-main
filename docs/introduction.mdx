## What is NikCLI?

NikCLI is a **next-generation AI-powered development assistant** that combines the power of artificial intelligence with practical development tools. Unlike traditional CLI tools, NikCLI features **cognitive orchestration** - an advanced system that understands natural language tasks, breaks them down intelligently, and executes them using the most appropriate strategies.

### Core Philosophy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cognitive Understanding">
    NikCLI uses advanced NLP to understand your intent, extract entities, and assess task complexity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intelligent Planning">
    Creates orchestration plans with optimal strategies (sequential, parallel, hybrid, adaptive)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adaptive Execution">
    Executes tasks with real-time supervision and automatic fallback strategies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Learning">
    Learns from each interaction to improve future task execution and planning
  </Step>
</Steps>
