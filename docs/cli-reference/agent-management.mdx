## Overview

NikCLI's agent management system provides control over AI agents, enabling you to execute tasks with specialized agents, create custom agents, and manage agent blueprints. The system includes two registered agents: the Universal Agent for comprehensive tasks and the VM Agent for isolated development.

Display all available agents and their current status.

```bash
# List all available agents
/agents
```

**Output includes:**
- Agent name and specialization
- Current status (active/idle)
- Basic capabilities overview

**Available Agents:**
- `universal-agent` - Full-stack development with 64 capabilities
- `vm-agent` - Secure virtualized development environment

### `/agent` - Execute with Specific Agent

Execute tasks using a specific agent.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Universal Agent">
    ```bash
    # Execute with universal agent
    /agent universal-agent "create a React login component"
    /agent universal-agent "optimize database queries"
    /agent universal-agent "implement API authentication"
    ```
    
    **Universal Agent Capabilities:**
    - Full-stack development (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
    - Database operations and optimization
    - API development and integration
    - Testing and debugging
    - DevOps and deployment
    - Code review and refactoring
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="VM Agent">

    /agent vm-agent "setup development environment"
    /agent vm-agent "clone and analyze repository"
    /agent vm-agent "create pull request with changes"
    ```
    
    **VM Agent Features:**
    - Docker container isolation
    - Repository cloning and analysis
    - Secure development environment
    - Pull request creation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### `/auto` - Autonomous Execution

Enable autonomous mode for complex tasks with minimal supervision.

```bash
# Simple autonomous task
/auto "create a todo application with React and Node.js"

# Complex autonomous project
/auto "build an e-commerce platform with authentication and payment processing"

# Autonomous optimization
/auto "identify and fix all performance issues in the project"
```

**Autonomous Features:**

```bash
/parallel "create full-stack authentication system"
```

## Agent Factory and Blueprints

### `/factory` - Agent Factory Dashboard

Access the agent factory for creating and managing custom agents.

```bash
/factory
```

**Factory Features:**

/create-agent "API Security Analyst"
```

**Agent Creation Process:**
1. Define agent specialization
2. Configure capabilities and tools
3. Set operational parameters
4. Deploy and activate agent

### `/launch-agent` - Launch from Blueprint

Deploy agents from pre-configured blueprints.

```bash
# Launch from saved blueprint
/launch-agent blueprint-id "implement user authentication"

# Launch with specific task

```bash
/blueprints
```

**Blueprint Information:**
- Blueprint ID and name
- Agent specialization
- Creation date
- Usage statistics

### `/blueprint` - View Specific Blueprint

View details of a specific blueprint.

```bash
/blueprint [blueprint-id]
```

### `/delete-blueprint` - Remove Blueprint

Delete a specific agent blueprint.

```bash
/delete-blueprint [blueprint-id]

### `/export-blueprint` - Export Blueprint

Export blueprint configuration for sharing or backup.

```bash
/export-blueprint [blueprint-id]
```

### `/import-blueprint` - Import Blueprint

Import a blueprint configuration from file.

```bash
/import-blueprint [file-path]
```

### `/search-blueprints` - Search Blueprints

Search blueprints by name, specialization, or capabilities.

```bash
/search-blueprints "react testing"
/search-blueprints "backend optimization"
```

## Context and Streaming

### `/context` - Workspace Context Management

Manage workspace context for focused agent operations.

```bash
# Show current context
/context

# Set specific paths
/context src/components/ src/hooks/

# Set context with multiple directories
/context src/ tests/ docs/
```

**Context Features:**
- Focused codebase analysis
- Improved agent performance
- Targeted operations
- Reduced processing overhead

### `/stream` - Agent Activity Streaming

Monitor live agent activity and execution streams.

```bash
# View agent stream dashboard
/stream

# Monitor specific operations
/stream [operation-id]
```

**Stream Features:**
- Real-time agent activity monitoring
- Progress tracking
- Error detection and reporting
- Performance metrics

## Agent System Architecture

### Registered Agents

NikCLI uses a focused approach with two primary registered agents:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Universal Agent">
    **Full-Stack Development Specialist**
    
    **64 Core Capabilities:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Not Responding">
    **Problem:** Agent fails to complete tasks or becomes unresponsive
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Check agent status
    /agents
    
    # View debug information
    /debug
    
    # Clear context and retry
    /clear
    /agent universal-agent "retry task"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Poor Task Results">
    **Problem:** Agent produces suboptimal results
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Set specific context
    /context src/components/
    
    # Use more detailed task description
    /agent universal-agent "create React login component with TypeScript, 
    form validation, error handling, and responsive design"
    
    # Try autonomous mode for complex tasks
    /auto "comprehensive task description with requirements"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Blueprint Issues">
    **Problem:** Blueprint creation or deployment fails
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # List available blueprints
    /blueprints
    
    # Search for similar blueprints
    /search-blueprints "relevant keywords"
    
    # Create new blueprint with specific parameters
    /create-agent "Descriptive Agent Name"

<Tip>
  Start with `/agents` to see available agents, then use `/agent universal-agent "task"` for most development tasks. For complex projects, try `/auto "description"` to enable autonomous execution.
