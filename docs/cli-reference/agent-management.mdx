## Overview

NikCLI's agent management system provides control over two registered AI agents, enabling autonomous development with intelligent task orchestration. The system includes the Universal Agent for comprehensive full-stack development and the VM Agent for isolated, secure development environments.

<Note>
  NikCLI uses **two registered agents** rather than multiple specialized agents. Both agents handle all development domains through intelligent cognitive routing and tool orchestration.

```

## Context and Streaming

### `/context` - Workspace Context Management

Manage workspace context for focused agent operations.

```bash
# Show current context
/context

# Set specific paths
/context src/components/ src/hooks/

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Not Responding">
    **Problem:** Agent fails to complete tasks or becomes unresponsive
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Check agent status
    /agents
    
    # View debug information
    /debug
    
    # Clear context and retry
    /clear
    /agent universal-agent "retry task"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Poor Task Results">
    **Problem:** Agent produces suboptimal results
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Set specific context
    /context src/components/
    
    # Use more detailed task description
    /agent universal-agent "create React login component with TypeScript, 
    form validation, error handling, and responsive design"
    
    # Try autonomous mode for complex tasks
    /auto "comprehensive task description with requirements"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Blueprint Issues">
    **Problem:** Blueprint creation or deployment fails
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # List available blueprints
    /blueprints
    
    # Search for similar blueprints
    /search-blueprints "relevant keywords"

<Tip>
  Start with `/agents` to see available agents, then use `/agent universal-agent "task"` for most development tasks. For complex projects, try `/auto "description"` to enable autonomous execution.
