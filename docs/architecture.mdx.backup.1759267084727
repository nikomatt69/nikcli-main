# NikCLI Architecture

## Overview

NikCLI is an advanced autonomous development environment powered by a comprehensive CLI ecosystem. It serves as a universal agent platform designed to handle full-stack development, DevOps, code analysis, optimization, and more. At its core, NikCLI integrates cognitive orchestration, specialized agents, and seamless tool integrations to execute complex tasks with efficiency and intelligence.

Key principles:
- **Autonomy**: Full access to CLI services for independent operation.
- **Modularity**: Specialized agents for domain-specific expertise.
- **Intelligence**: TaskMaster AI for planning and adaptive execution.
- **Extensibility**: Integrations with external APIs and build systems.

This document synthesizes the project structure from directory exploration, highlighting core components, integrations, and operational flows. For visual representation, refer to the `nikcli_architecture.mmd` flowchart in the docs/assets directory, which illustrates the high-level system diagram.

## Agent System

The NikCLI agent system is a modular architecture comprising a primary Universal Agent and specialized agents for targeted domains. Each agent leverages the Orchestrator Service for coordination and the Context System for workspace intelligence. Below is an overview of the key components:

### Universal Agent
- **Role**: Primary coordinator and fallback executor for all tasks.
- **Capabilities**: Cognitive orchestration, task routing, and adaptive supervision.
- **Core Functions**:
  - Intent classification and entity extraction via NLP.
  - Complexity assessment (1-10 scale) and strategy selection (sequential, parallel, hybrid, adaptive).
  - Integration with TaskMaster AI for task breakdown into 5-8 actionable subtasks.
- **Usage**: Handles any development request, delegating to specialized agents as needed.

### React Agent
- **Role**: Frontend development specialist focused on UI/UX components.
- **Capabilities**: Component creation, state management, and React ecosystem integration (e.g., Next.js, Vite).
- **Core Functions**:
  - Generates JSX/TSX code with hooks and best practices.
  - Optimizes for performance using memoization and lazy loading.
- **Example Integration**: Automates creation of responsive components based on design specs.

### Backend Agent
- **Role**: Server-side architecture and API development expert.
- **Capabilities**: Node.js/Express, database modeling (e.g., Prisma, MongoDB), and REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **Core Functions**:
  - Designs scalable endpoints with authentication and validation.
  - Handles middleware for error handling and logging.
- **TypeScript Example** (for API endpoint):
  ```tsx
  // types/api.ts - Define proper types for production-ready backend
  export interface UserRequest {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    role: 'admin' | 'user';
  }

  export interface ApiResponse<T> {
    data: T;
    status: number;
    message?: string;
  }

  // Complex logic: Validate and process user request with error handling
  export const processUser = async (req: UserRequest): Promise<ApiResponse<UserRequest>> => {
    // Comment: Input validation using Zod or similar for production safety
    if (!req.email || !req.id) {
      throw new Error('Invalid request data');
    }
    // Simulate backend processing (e.g., DB query)
    const processed = { ...req, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() };
    return { data: processed, status: 200 };
  };
  ```

### DevOps Agent
- **Role**: Infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD operations specialist.
- **Capabilities**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and cloud integrations (AWS, Vercel).
- **Core Functions**:
  - Automates pipeline setup and environment provisioning.
  - Manages secrets and monitoring with health checks.

### Code Review Agent
- **Role**: Quality assurance and code analysis expert.
- **Capabilities**: Linting, security scanning, and best practices enforcement (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube).
- **Core Functions**:
  - Performs static analysis and suggests refactors.
  - Ensures adherence to coding standards.

### Optimization Agent
- **Role**: Performance tuning and efficiency improvement specialist.
- **Capabilities**: Profiling, caching strategies, and resource optimization.
- **Core Functions**:
  - Analyzes bottlenecks and applies fixes (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading).
  - Uses metrics for iterative improvements.

These agents communicate via the Orchestrator Service, enabling hybrid execution for complex tasks.

## API Integrations

NikCLI integrates with external APIs to enhance functionality, ensuring secure and efficient interactions. Key integrations include:

- **Health Checks**: Internal endpoints for system monitoring (e.g., `/health` route returning status and uptime).
  - **Implementation**: Uses Express.js middleware for periodic pings.
  - **Example Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "healthy",
      "uptime": "99.9%",
      "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

- **GitHub API**: For version control operations like cloning repos, creating PRs, and issue management.
  - **Authentication**: OAuth tokens stored securely (never exposed in code).
  - **Core Functions**:
    - Fetch repository structure for context-aware planning.
    - Automate commits and pushes via Git Integration service.
  - **TypeScript Snippet** (production-ready with error handling):
    ```tsx
    // integrations/github.ts - GitHub API client with types
    import { Octokit } from '@octokit/rest'; // Ensure @octokit/rest is installed

    interface GitHubConfig {
      token: string; // Comment: Use environment variables in production (process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN)
      owner: string;
      repo: string;
    }

    export class GitHubIntegrator {
      private octokit: Octokit;

      constructor(config: GitHubConfig) {
        this.octokit = new Octokit({ auth: config.token });
      }

      // Complex logic: Fetch repo files with pagination and error retry
      async getRepoFiles(path: string = ''): Promise<string[]> {
        try {
          const { data } = await this.octokit.repos.getContent({
            owner: this.config.owner, // Assume config stored privately
            repo: this.config.repo,
            path,
          });
          // Comment: Handle directory vs file recursively for full exploration
          if (Array.isArray(data)) {
            return data.map((item: any) => item.name);
          }
          return [];
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('GitHub API error:', error);
          // Fallback: Return empty array for graceful degradation
          return [];
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Other integrations: NPM for package management, AI providers for streaming responses.

## Flows

### Task Execution Protocol
NikCLI follows a structured protocol for reliable execution:

1. **Cognitive Analysis**: Parse intent, extract entities, assess complexity.
2. **TaskMaster Planning**: Generate 5-8 subtasks with priorities and tools.
3. **Adaptive Execution**: Route to agents, use parallel/sequential strategies.
4. **Quality Assurance**: Validate, test, and document.

This flow ensures minimal errors and optimal performance. See the flowchart for dependencies.

### Cognitive Orchestration
- **Intent Classification**: Categorize actions (e.g., create, analyze).
- **Strategy Selection**: Based on complexity (e.g., hybrid for 7-8 scale).
- **Agent Coordination**: Universal Agent supervises, intervenes as needed.
- **Adaptation**: Learn from executions for future optimizations.
