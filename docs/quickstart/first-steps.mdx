## Basic Interaction Patterns

### Natural Language Commands

NikCLI understands natural language, so you can communicate as you would with a human developer:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Request">
    ```
    > Create a simple React component for a button
    ```
    
    NikCLI will analyze your project, understand the context, and create an appropriate React component.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Complex Task">
    ```
    > Add user authentication to my Express.js app with JWT tokens and bcrypt for password hashing
    ```
    
    NikCLI will break this down into multiple steps and execute them systematically.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="File Operations">
    ```
    > Read the package.json file and update the version to 1.2.0
    ```
    
    NikCLI will read the file, understand its structure, and make the requested change.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Interactive Modes

NikCLI offers different interaction modes for various workflows:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Chat Mode" icon="comments">
    Default conversational interface for interactive development
  </Card>

    ```
    
    NikCLI will:
    - Create Express.js server
    - Implement route handlers
    - Add data models and types
    - Include error handling
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Testing">
    ```
    > Add unit tests for the todo API endpoints using Jest
    ```
    
    NikCLI will:
    - Configure Jest
    - Create test files
    - Write comprehensive test cases
    - Set up test scripts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and Run">
    ```
    > Show me what files were created and run the tests
    ```
    
    NikCLI will provide a summary and execute the test suite.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Essential Slash Commands

    Enter autonomous execution mode
    ```
    > /auto "Build a login page"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="/plan">
    Switch to planning mode for complex tasks
    ```
    > /plan
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    ```
    > /help
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="/agents">
    List available agents and their capabilities
    ```
    > /agents
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    List files in current directory
    ```
    > /ls src/
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="/read">
    Read and display file contents
    ```
    > /read package.json
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="/search">
    Search across files (grep-like)
    ```
    > /search "interface User"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding NikCLI's Workflow

### 1. Context Analysis
When you give NikCLI a task, it first analyzes your project:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Request] --> B[Project Analysis]
    B --> C[Technology Detection]
    C --> D[Context Building]
    D --> E[Task Planning]
    E --> F[Execution]
```

### 2. Task Breakdown
Complex tasks are automatically broken down into manageable steps:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/task-breakdown.png" alt="Task Breakdown Example" />
</Frame>

### 3. Real-time Feedback
NikCLI provides continuous feedback during execution:

```
üîç Analyzing project structure...
üìÅ Found React TypeScript project
üéØ Planning component creation...
‚úèÔ∏è  Creating Button.tsx...
‚úÖ Component created successfully
üß™ Running type checks...
‚úÖ All checks passed
```
