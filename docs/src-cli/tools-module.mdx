## Tool Categories

NikCLI's tools are organized into logical categories for easy discovery and use.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File Operations" icon="folder-open">
    Tools for reading, writing, editing, and managing files in your project.

    ### Available Commands
    - **`/read`**: Read the contents of a file.
    - **`/write`**: Write content to a file (creates or overwrites).
    - **`/edit`**: Edit a file using AI-powered suggestions.
    - **`/multi-edit`**: Edit multiple files simultaneously.
    - **`/ls`**: List files and directories.
    - **`/search`**: Search for files by name or pattern.
    - **`/grep`**: Search for text within files.
    - **`/tree`**: Display directory structure as a tree.

    ### Example Usage
    ```bash
    # Read a file
    /read src/components/Button.tsx

    # Write to a file
    /write src/utils/helpers.ts "export const formatDate = (date) => { /* ... */ }"

    # Edit a file with AI assistance
    /edit src/components/Button.tsx "Add a loading state to the button component"

    # Search for files
    /search "*.test.ts"

    # Search within files
    /grep "TODO" src/**/*.ts
    ```

    ### Best Practices
    - **Use `/read` before `/edit`**: Always read a file first to understand its current state before making changes.
    - **Review diffs**: Always review the diff preview before confirming file edits.
    - **Use patterns**: Use glob patterns with `/search` and `/grep` for efficient file discovery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Terminal Operations" icon="terminal">
    Tools for executing shell commands, managing processes, and interacting with the terminal.

    ### Available Commands
    - **`/run`**: Execute a shell command.
    - **`/sh`**: Run a shell script.
    - **`/bash`**: Execute a bash command.
    - **`/install`**: Install packages using the detected package manager.
    - **`/npm`**: Run npm commands.
    - **`/yarn`**: Run yarn commands.
    - **`/git`**: Execute git commands.
    - **`/docker`**: Run docker commands.

    - **Clean up**: Periodically clean up old memories and snapshots to keep the system organized.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tool Architecture

All tools in NikCLI extend the `BaseTool` class, which provides a common interface for execution, validation, and error handling.

```typescript
// Example: BaseTool structure
abstract class BaseTool {
  abstract name: string;
  abstract description: string;
  abstract execute(params: any): Promise<any>;
  
  validate(params: any): boolean {
    // Validation logic
  }
  
  handleError(error: Error): void {
    // Error handling logic
  }
}
```

### Creating a Custom Tool

You can create custom tools by extending the `BaseTool` class:

```typescript
import { BaseTool } from './tools/base-tool';

export class MyCustomTool extends BaseTool {
  name = 'my-custom-tool';
  description = 'A custom tool that does something amazing';
  
  async execute(params: { input: string }): Promise<string> {
    // Your tool logic here
    const result = await this.doSomething(params.input);
    return result;
  }
  
  validate(params: any): boolean {
    return typeof params.input === 'string';
  }
  
  private async doSomething(input: string): Promise<string> {
    // Implementation
    return `Processed: ${input}`;
  }
}
```

### Registering a Custom Tool

Once you've created a custom tool, register it with the tool registry:

```typescript
import { ToolRegistry } from './tools/tool-registry';
import { MyCustomTool } from './my-custom-tool';

const registry = ToolRegistry.getInstance();
registry.register(new MyCustomTool());
```

## Secure Tools

NikCLI includes a secure tools system for operations that require special permissions or could potentially harm the system.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approval System">
    **Interactive Approval for Sensitive Operations**

    The approval system ensures that potentially dangerous operations require explicit user confirmation before execution.

    ```bash
    # Example: File write with approval
    /write package.json "{ ... }"
    # → Shows diff preview
    # → Asks for confirmation
    # → Executes only after approval
    ```

    ### Configuring Approval Mode
    ```bash
    # Enable approval mode
    /config set approval.enabled true

    # Set approval level (low, medium, high)
    /config set approval.level medium
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Sandbox Mode">
    **Restricted Execution Environment**

    Sandbox mode provides a restricted execution environment with configurable permissions, ensuring that tools cannot access or modify resources outside of the sandbox.

    ```bash
    # Enable sandbox mode
    /config set sandbox.enabled true

    # Configure sandbox permissions
    /config set sandbox.permissions.filesystem read-only
    /config set sandbox.permissions.network disabled
    ```

    ### Sandbox Permissions
    - **Filesystem**: `read-only`, `read-write`, `disabled`
    - **Network**: `enabled`, `disabled`
    - **Process**: `enabled`, `disabled`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VM Isolation">
    **Secure Virtualized Execution**

    For maximum security, use the VM Agent to execute tools in a completely isolated Docker container.

    ```bash
    # Execute a command in a secure VM
    /vm-agent "Install and test this third-party library"

    # Create a VM for a specific task
    /vm-create --name test-env --image node:18

    # Connect to a VM
    /vm-connect test-env

    # Execute a command in the VM
    /vm-exec test-env "npm install suspicious-package"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
