- **Logging**: Sensitive information may be logged in plain text
- **Session Persistence**: User sessions and data may persist longer than expected
- **Cross-Contamination**: Data from different projects may be mixed

### **Authentication and Authorization**

- **Weak Authentication**: Authentication mechanisms may be bypassed
- **Session Hijacking**: User sessions may be compromised
- **Role Confusion**: May not properly enforce role-based access controls
- **Token Exposure**: Authentication tokens may be exposed in logs or memory
- **Credential Storage**: Credentials may be stored insecurely

### **Container and Virtualization Risks**

- **Container Escape**: VM agents may attempt to escape container isolation
- **Resource Isolation**: May not properly isolate resources between agents
- **Image Vulnerabilities**: Container images may contain security vulnerabilities
- **Network Isolation**: May not properly isolate network traffic
- **Volume Mounting**: May mount sensitive host directories

### **Configuration and Environment**

- **Configuration Exposure**: Sensitive configuration may be exposed
- **Environment Variables**: May read or modify sensitive environment variables
- **Secret Management**: Secrets may be stored or transmitted insecurely
- **Default Settings**: Default configurations may be insecure
- **Validation Bypass**: Input validation may be bypassed

### **Agent System Risks**

- **Agent Privilege Escalation**: Agents may gain unauthorized privileges
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents may communicate sensitive data
- **Agent Persistence**: Agents may persist beyond intended lifecycle
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple agents may compete for system resources
- **Agent Injection**: Malicious agents may be injected into the system

### **Development and Testing Risks**

- **Test Data Exposure**: Test data may contain sensitive information
- **Debug Information**: Debug information may expose system internals
- **Error Messages**: Error messages may reveal sensitive system information
- **Logging Levels**: Inappropriate logging levels may expose sensitive data
- **Development Artifacts**: Development artifacts may contain sensitive data

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY FEATURES (BETA IMPLEMENTATION)

### **Current Security Measures**

- **Approval System**: Requires user approval for high-risk operations
- **Command Validation**: Validates commands before execution
- **File Operation Restrictions**: Restricts file operations to workspace
- **API Key Encryption**: Encrypts API keys in configuration
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions with timeouts
- **Audit Logging**: Logs security-relevant events
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitizes user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits API request rates

### **Security Modes**

- **Safe Mode**: Most restrictive, requires approval for most operations
- **Default Mode**: Balanced security with selective approvals
- **Developer Mode**: Less restrictive for development workflows

### **Tool Security Policies**

- **File Operations**: Configurable approval policies
- **Git Operations**: Approval required for destructive operations
- **Package Operations**: Approval for package installations
- **System Commands**: Approval for system-level commands
- **Network Requests**: Approval for external requests
