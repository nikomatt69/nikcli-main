    %% High-level architecture diagram for Vercel AI Gateway
    %% This follows Mermaid best practices: uses subgraphs for logical grouping,
    %% top-down (TD) direction for readability, solid lines for data flow,
    %% dotted lines for monitoring/observability, and clear node labels.
    %% Nodes represent components; edges show interactions.
    %% Designed for production docs: concise, scalable, and integrable into Vercel docs/Markdown.
    %% Vercel patterns: Emphasizes edge deployment integration (e.g., Vercel Deployments)
    %% and AI SDK routing, aligning with serverless/edge runtime patterns.
    %% No TypeScript types here as this is a diagramming language (Mermaid);
    %% for TS integration, see example in docs: e.g., type GatewayRequest = { provider: 'openai' | 'anthropic'; ... }
    %% Complex logic comment: Request flow - Router handles incoming requests from AI SDK/Deployments,
    %% checks Cache (hit/miss logic), routes to Providers if miss, caches response, and logs via Observability.

### Documentation Notes
- **Mermaid Best Practices Followed**: Subgraphs for modularity, clear labels with `<br/>` for multi-line, consistent direction (TB within subgraphs for hierarchy), and semantic styling via `classDef` for visual distinction in rendered docs (e.g., Vercel-themed colors). Avoids overly complex edges; focuses on high-level flow.
- **Vercel Patterns**: Diagram highlights integration with Vercel Deployments (e.g., Edge Functions for low-latency routing) and AI SDK (for seamless AI call abstraction), aligning with Vercel's serverless/edge architecture. Caching layer implies Vercel KV/Edge Config patterns for production caching.
- **TypeScript Integration Example** (for docs completeness, as per requirements â€“ this is not Mermaid but a companion snippet for TypeScript usage in Vercel projects):
  ```typescript
  // Example TypeScript types for AI Gateway interactions (production-ready, with JSDoc comments)
  // Complex logic: Provider routing uses union types; caching handled via optional TTL.

  /**
   * Configuration for Vercel AI Gateway requests.
   * Integrates with AI SDK for provider abstraction.
   */
  export interface GatewayConfig {
    provider: 'openai' | 'anthropic';  // Supported providers as per diagram
    model?: string;  // e.g., 'gpt-4' or 'claude-3'
    apiKey: string;  // Stored securely via Vercel Environment Variables
  }

  /**
   * Request payload routed through the Gateway.
   * Router handles validation; Cache checks for existing responses.
   */
  export interface GatewayRequest extends GatewayConfig {
    prompt: string;
    maxTokens?: number;
    cacheTtl?: number;  // Seconds for caching layer (Vercel KV integration)
  }

  /**
   * Response from
