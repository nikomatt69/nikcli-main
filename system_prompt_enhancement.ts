/**
 * NikCLI System Prompt Configuration Module
 * 
 * This module exports an enhanced version of the NikCLI Universal Agent system prompt.
 * Enhancement: Added TaskMaster fallback logic for manual task breakdown if AI generation fails.
 * 
 * Usage in Node.js:
 *   import { updatedNikCLIPrompt } from './nikcli-prompt-config';
 *   console.log(updatedNikCLIPrompt); // Use for config updates or runtime injection
 * 
 * Best Practices Applied:
 * - Strict TypeScript typing with interfaces.
 * - Immutable exports using `const` and `readonly`.
 * - JSDoc comments for clarity.
 * - No external dependencies; pure Node-compatible ES module.
 * - Production-ready: Handles string immutability, no sensitive data exposure.
