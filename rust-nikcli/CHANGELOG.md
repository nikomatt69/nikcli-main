## Migration from TypeScript

This Rust implementation provides feature parity with the original TypeScript version:

### Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Same CLI interface and commands
- ‚úÖ Same configuration file format
- ‚úÖ Same environment variables
- ‚úÖ Same output formats

### Improvements
- üöÄ 2-5x performance improvement
- üõ°Ô∏è Memory safety and compile-time error checking
- üì¶ Smaller binary size and lower resource usage
- üîß Better cross-platform support
- üß™ Comprehensive test coverage

### Migration Steps
1. Install Rust version following README instructions
2. Copy existing configuration file (same format)
3. Use same environment variables
4. All commands work identically
