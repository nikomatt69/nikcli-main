```

## Todo Items (11)

### 1. ‚è≥ Set up development environment ‚ö°

**Description:** Navigate to the project directory at /Volumes/SSD/Documents/Personal/nikcli-main, install any dependencies (e.g., via pip if Python-based), and ensure the code runs in a virtual environment to avoid global pollution.

**Category:** setup | **Priority:** high | **Duration:** 30min

**Reasoning:** A proper setup is essential before any bug hunting to ensure reproducibility and isolate issues. This fits as the foundational step in the overall plan to analyze and fix the project.

**Files:** `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`

**Commands:**
- `cd /Volumes/SSD/Documents/Personal/nikcli-main`
- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Tags:** #setup #environment

---

### 2. ‚è≥ Run initial manual execution of the CLI ‚ö°

**Description:** Execute the main CLI script with various inputs to observe runtime behavior, crashes, or unexpected outputs. Document any immediate errors or anomalies in a bug log file.

**Category:** testing | **Priority:** high | **Duration:** 45min

**Reasoning:** Manual testing uncovers runtime bugs that static analysis might miss. This is a logical early step after setup to identify surface-level issues before deeper review.

**Dependencies:** 0

**Files:** `nikcli.py`, `bugs_log.md`

**Commands:**
- `python nikcli.py --help`
- `python nikcli.py --version`
- `python nikcli.py <sample-input>`

**Tags:** #testing #runtime

---

### 3. ‚è≥ Perform static code analysis with linter üìã

**Description:** Install and run a linter like pylint or flake8 on the codebase to detect syntax errors, style issues, and potential bugs like unused variables or type mismatches.

**Category:** testing | **Priority:** medium | **Duration:** 30min

**Reasoning:** Static analysis quickly finds common bugs without running the code, complementing manual testing. It ensures code quality issues are flagged early in the bug-finding process.

**Dependencies:** 0

**Files:** `nikcli.py`, `.pylintrc`

**Commands:**
- `pip install pylint`
- `pylint nikcli.py`
- `flake8 .`

**Tags:** #static-analysis #linting

---

### 4. ‚è≥ Review code structure and logic manually üìã

**Description:** Read through key files (e.g., main script, modules) to identify logical errors, such as incorrect conditionals, missing error handling, or inefficient code paths. Note findings in the bug log.

**Category:** testing | **Priority:** medium | **Duration:** 60min

**Reasoning:** Manual review catches subtle bugs that tools miss. This builds on initial testing results, providing a comprehensive view of potential issues before prioritizing fixes.

**Dependencies:** 1, 2

**Files:** `nikcli.py`, `bugs_log.md`

**Tags:** #code-review #logic

---

### 5. ‚è≥ Run or create unit tests ‚ö°

**Description:** Check for existing tests and run them using pytest or unittest. If none exist, write basic tests for core functions and execute to expose failing cases, logging new bugs.

**Category:** testing | **Priority:** high | **Duration:** 45min

**Reasoning:** Unit tests systematically reveal bugs in isolated components. This step ensures test-driven bug discovery, making future fixes verifiable and progressive.

**Dependencies:** 1

**Files:** `tests/test_nikcli.py`, `bugs_log.md`

**Commands:**
- `pip install pytest`
- `pytest tests/`
- `python -m unittest discover`

**Tags:** #unit-testing #automation

---

### 6. ‚è≥ Debug runtime issues with a debugger üìã

**Description:** Use pdb or an IDE debugger to step through code during execution, focusing on areas flagged in previous steps. Reproduce and document stack traces or variable states for bugs.

**Category:** testing | **Priority:** medium | **Duration:** 45min

**Reasoning:** Debugging provides deep insights into elusive bugs. It follows initial runs to target specific failures, advancing the bug identification phase logically.

**Dependencies:** 1, 3

**Files:** `nikcli.py`, `bugs_log.md`

**Commands:**
- `python -m pdb nikcli.py <input>`

**Tags:** #debugging #runtime

---

### 7. ‚è≥ Compile and categorize all found bugs üî•

**Description:** Review the bug log, categorize bugs (e.g., syntax, logic, performance), assign severity (critical, high, medium, low), and estimate impact. Create a prioritized bug list.

**Category:** planning | **Priority:** critical | **Duration:** 30min

**Reasoning:** Synthesizing findings into a categorized list is key to transitioning from discovery to planning. This ensures fixes are addressed progressively by severity.

**Dependencies:** 2, 3, 4, 5

**Files:** `bugs_log.md`, `prioritized_bugs.md`

**Tags:** #bug-tracking #prioritization

---

### 8. ‚è≥ Generate high-level fix plan for critical bugs üî•

**Description:** For each critical bug, outline steps to fix: describe the root cause, proposed changes, and verification method. Add as subtasks or notes in the plan document.

**Category:** planning | **Priority:** critical | **Duration:** 45min

**Reasoning:** Planning fixes for critical bugs first ensures high-impact issues are resolved early, making the overall fix process safe and logical by starting with the most urgent.

**Dependencies:** 6

**Files:** `fix_plan.md`, `prioritized_bugs.md`

**Tags:** #fix-planning #critical

---

### 9. ‚è≥ Generate fix plan for high-priority bugs ‚ö°

**Description:** Similar to critical, outline fixes for high-priority bugs, ensuring dependencies on critical fixes are noted. Include estimated effort and potential risks.

**Category:** planning | **Priority:** high | **Duration:** 30min

**Reasoning:** Progressive planning by priority maintains momentum after critical fixes, building a logical sequence where lower-priority items depend on resolved higher ones.

**Dependencies:** 7

**Files:** `fix_plan.md`

**Tags:** #fix-planning #high

---

### 10. ‚è≥ Generate fix plan for medium and low-priority bugs üìã

**Description:** Outline fixes for remaining bugs, grouping similar ones for efficiency. Ensure the plan includes testing after each fix to avoid regressions.

**Category:** planning | **Priority:** medium | **Duration:** 30min

**Reasoning:** Completing the fix plan for all bugs ensures comprehensiveness. This final planning step creates an executable roadmap, fitting the goal of a progressive fix strategy.

**Dependencies:** 8

**Files:** `fix_plan.md`

**Tags:** #fix-planning #medium #low

---

### 11. ‚è≥ Document the overall bug-finding and fix plan üìã

**Description:** Summarize the process used to find bugs, the prioritized list, and the full fix plan in a single document. Include timelines and responsibilities if applicable.

**Category:** documentation | **Priority:** medium | **Duration:** 20min

**Reasoning:** Documentation captures the entire effort for future reference and team use. It concludes the plan, ensuring the generated fix strategy is actionable and traceable.

**Dependencies:** 9

**Files:** `bug_audit_report.md`, `fix_plan.md`

**Tags:** #documentation #summary
