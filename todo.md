## Description

now analyze workspace and show me optimizations

## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 0
- **File Modifications:** 2
- **External Calls:** 0

## Tasks

### 1. ✓ Analyze Project Structure & Dependencies 🔴

**Description:** Execute comprehensive project analysis to identify current workspace structure, technology stack, dependencies, and potential optimization opportunities. Use analyze_project tool with all analysis flags enabled including security checks and dependency optimization suggestions.

**Tools:** analyze_project, explore_directory

**Reasoning:** Foundation for all subsequent optimization analysis - need to understand project composition, dependencies, and existing patterns before recommending optimizations

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. ✓ Identify Performance Bottlenecks 🔴

**Description:** Search codebase for performance-critical sections using grep patterns. Look for inefficient algorithms, N+1 query patterns, unoptimized loops, and heavy dependencies. Analyze execution bottlenecks and resource usage patterns across the workspace.

**Tools:** grep, code_analysis

**Reasoning:** Performance optimization is a key metric - need to identify specific bottlenecks before recommending improvements

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 3. ✓ Audit Code Quality & Security Issues 🔴

**Description:** Run code quality analysis on key files using code_analysis tool with security focus. Check for common vulnerabilities, code smells, and security anti-patterns. Generate detailed quality report with recommendations.

**Tools:** code_analysis, dependency_analysis

**Reasoning:** Security and code quality directly impact maintainability and reliability - must be identified early in optimization planning

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 4. ⚡︎ Analyze Build & Bundle Size 🟡

**Description:** Execute build commands and analyze generated bundle sizes. Identify unused dependencies, large imports, and optimization opportunities in build output. Check for tree-shaking effectiveness and redundant dependencies.

**Tools:** execute_command, grep

**Reasoning:** Bundle size directly affects performance metrics - optimization here can significantly improve load times and user experience

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 15%

---

### 5. ⏳ Review Dependency Tree for Redundancies 🟡

**Description:** Perform comprehensive dependency analysis to identify duplicate dependencies, outdated packages, and unused modules. Check for security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. Suggest consolidations and upgrades.

**Tools:** dependency_analysis, grep

**Reasoning:** Dependency optimization reduces complexity, improves security, and decreases bundle size - critical for maintenance

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 6. ⏳ Generate Optimization Recommendations Report 🔴

**Description:** Compile findings from all analysis tasks into a comprehensive optimization report. Document specific improvements with estimated impact, priority levels, and implementation complexity. Include quick wins and strategic improvements.

**Tools:** write_file

**Reasoning:** Consolidate all findings into actionable recommendations that developers can immediately implement

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 7. ⏳ Assess Git Workflow & Commit Patterns 🟡

**Description:** Analyze repository patterns using git_workflow tool. Review branching strategy, commit frequency, and collaboration patterns. Identify opportunities for improved workflow efficiency and team coordination.

**Tools:** git_workflow

**Reasoning:** Workflow optimization improves team productivity and code quality consistency

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 8. ⏳ Document Optimization Implementation Plan 🟡

**Description:** Create prioritized action plan for implementing recommended optimizations. Include implementation steps, estimated effort, risk assessment, and rollback procedures. Organize by quick wins vs. long-term improvements.

**Tools:** write_file

**Reasoning:** Clear implementation roadmap ensures optimizations are executed systematically with measurable outcomes

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%
