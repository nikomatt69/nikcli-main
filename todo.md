## Description

allora a sto punto pianifica tutto e poi in maniera safe eseguilo

## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 0
- **File Modifications:** 5
- **External Calls:** 0

## Tasks

### 1. ✓ Analyze Current Project Structure 🔴

**Description:** Read project configuration files, explore directory structure, and analyze existing codebase to understand the current state and identify what needs to be planned. This establishes baseline context for all subsequent planning and execution tasks.

**Tools:** explore_directory, read_file, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Essential foundation - must understand project scope, dependencies, and structure before creating comprehensive plan

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. ✓ Generate Comprehensive Task Breakdown 🔴

**Description:** Based on project analysis, create a detailed breakdown of all work items needed. Identify dependencies, prioritize tasks, estimate resource requirements, and map out the complete execution strategy in a safe, sequential manner.

**Tools:** doc_search, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Critical planning phase - establishes roadmap for safe execution and prevents errors through proper sequencing

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 3. ✓ Validate Safety Prerequisites 🔴

**Description:** Verify all safety requirements are met before execution: check Git status, ensure backups exist, validate file permissions, verify no destructive operations will be executed without safeguards, and confirm rollback capabilities are available.

**Tools:** execute_command, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Safety-critical phase - ensures no data loss and maintains system stability during execution

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 4. ⚡︎ Create Backup and Version Control Snapshots 🔴

**Description:** Execute safe backup procedures: create Git commit checkpoint, backup critical files, document current state. This establishes recovery points before any modifications begin.

**Tools:** execute_command

**Reasoning:** Protection mechanism - enables safe rollback if any issues arise during execution

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 15%

---

### 5. ⏳ Execute Primary Tasks with Monitoring 🔴

**Description:** Execute planned tasks sequentially with continuous monitoring: implement changes, validate after each step, verify success criteria are met. Stop and assess before proceeding to next phase if issues detected.

**Tools:** write_file, execute_command, generate_code

**Reasoning:** Main execution phase - implements planned work with safety checkpoints and validation gates

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 6. ⏳ Validate All Changes and Run Tests 🔴

**Description:** Comprehensive validation: verify all modifications are correct, run automated tests if available, check for regressions, confirm expected functionality works. Document any issues found.

**Tools:** execute_command, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Quality assurance phase - ensures modifications are correct and system stability is maintained

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 7. ⏳ Document Changes and Create Summary Report 🟡

**Description:** Create comprehensive documentation: list all changes made, document decision rationale, note any issues encountered, provide rollback instructions if needed, and summarize outcomes.

**Tools:** write_file, read_file

**Reasoning:** Transparency and maintainability - provides clear audit trail and future reference

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 8. ⏳ Final Safety Verification and Commit 🔴

**Description:** Perform final system check: verify all changes persisted correctly, confirm no side effects, commit changes to version control with clear messages, and mark execution as complete.

**Tools:** execute_command, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Closure phase - ensures safe persistence and creates permanent record of all modifications

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%
