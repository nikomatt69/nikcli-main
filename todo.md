# TaskMaster AI Plan: Parallel Agents (2): TaskMaster Plan: analyze workspace with deep analysis and searches and generate a report at the root .md

**Generated:** 2025-10-08T00:13:09.601Z
**Planning Engine:** TaskMaster AI
**Request:** analyze workspace with deep analysis and searches and generate a report at the root .md
**Risk Level:** medium
**Estimated Duration:** 65 minutes

## Description

analyze workspace with deep analysis and searches and generate a report at the root .md

## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 0
- **File Modifications:** 1
- **External Calls:** 1

## Tasks

### 1. âœ“ Gather workspace intelligence data ðŸ”´

**Description:** Use explore_directory to scan the entire workspace structure, then run analyze_project to get comprehensive metrics including dependencies, security scan, and code quality assessment. Document all findings in memory for the final report.

**Tools:** explore_directory, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Essential baseline data collection to understand project structure, dependencies, and potential issues before deep analysis

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. âœ“ Perform semantic codebase analysis ðŸ”´

**Description:** Execute semantic_search with queries for key patterns like 'authentication', 'database', 'api endpoints', 'error handling', and 'configuration' to identify architectural patterns and potential issues across the codebase.

**Tools:** semantic_search

**Reasoning:** Deep semantic analysis reveals hidden patterns, architectural decisions, and potential technical debt that basic file scanning misses

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 3. âœ“ Analyze dependency vulnerabilities ðŸ”´

**Description:** Run dependency_analysis to check for security vulnerabilities, outdated packages, and optimization opportunities. Cross-reference findings with security scan results from project analysis.

**Tools:** dependency_analysis

**Reasoning:** Security and dependency health are critical for project stability - this identifies immediate risks and maintenance needs

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 4. âœ“ Generate code quality insights ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Select 3-5 key files identified in semantic search and run code_analysis on each for quality, patterns, security, and performance. Focus on files with high complexity or frequent patterns.

**Tools:** code_analysis, read_file

**Reasoning:** Targeted code quality analysis provides actionable insights about specific areas that need attention or refactoring

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 5. âœ“ Compile comprehensive workspace report ðŸ”´

**Description:** Aggregate all collected data (project structure, metrics, vulnerabilities, semantic patterns, code quality findings) into a structured markdown report at workspace root. Include executive summary, key findings, recommendations, and action items.

**Tools:** write_file, generate_code

**Reasoning:** Final deliverable that synthesizes all analysis into actionable intelligence for project stakeholders

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%
