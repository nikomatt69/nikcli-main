quando in vm mode finisce il task e riappare il prompt ce ancora qualcosa che bluocca il flusso analizza cosa puo essere

## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 0
- **File Modifications:** 3
- **External Calls:** 0

## Tasks

### 1. âœ… Reproduce VM Mode Task Completion Issue ðŸ”´

**Description:** Step 1: Launch the environment in VM mode. Step 2: Execute a sample task until completion. Step 3: Observe the prompt reappearance and any blocking behavior in the flow. Step 4: Document the exact sequence of events, including timestamps and outputs.

**Tools:** execute_command, explore_directory

**Reasoning:** Reproducing the issue is essential to understand the exact behavior and confirm the blocking occurs consistently, providing a baseline for analysis.

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. âœ… Review VM Mode Documentation and Configs ðŸ”´

**Description:** Step 1: Search for official documentation on VM mode task handling and prompt management. Step 2: Read relevant configuration files in the project directory. Step 3: Identify any settings related to task termination, prompt restoration, and flow control. Step 4: Note potential misconfigurations.

**Tools:** doc_search, read_file, explore_directory

**Reasoning:** Understanding the intended behavior from docs and configs is crucial to differentiate between expected functionality and actual bugs causing the block.

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 3. âœ… Analyze Logs for Post-Task Blocking ðŸ”´

**Description:** Step 1: Locate and read log files generated during VM mode execution. Step 2: Filter logs for entries around task completion and prompt reappearance. Step 3: Look for error messages, hanging processes, or resource locks. Step 4: Correlate logs with observed blocking symptoms.

**Tools:** read_file, execute_command

**Reasoning:** Logs provide direct evidence of what happens internally after task end, helping pinpoint root causes like unclosed resources or errors that block the flow.

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 4. âœ… Inspect System State After Task Finish ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Step 1: After reproducing the issue, use commands to check running processes, open files, and memory usage in VM mode. Step 2: Identify any lingering threads, locks, or dependencies from the completed task. Step 3: Compare state before and after prompt reappearance. Step 4: Document anomalies.

**Tools:** execute_command, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Examining the runtime state reveals hidden blockers like zombie processes or held resources that prevent smooth flow resumption.

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 5. âœ… Identify Potential Causes of Flow Block ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Step 1: Based on reproduction, logs, and state analysis, list possible causes (e.g., signal handling issues, event loop blocks, config errors). Step 2: Cross-reference with known issues in documentation or similar reports. Step 3: Prioritize likely culprits. Step 4: Hypothesize fixes for each.

**Tools:** doc_search, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Synthesizing findings into potential causes is key to targeted troubleshooting, avoiding blind fixes and focusing on high-impact solutions.

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 6. âœ… Test Hypotheses and Propose Fixes ðŸŸ¢

**Description:** Step 1: For each hypothesized cause, design a simple test or modification. Step 2: Implement and execute tests in a safe environment. Step 3: Verify if the block is resolved. Step 4: If successful, document the fix; if not, iterate or escalate.

**Tools:** execute_command, write_file, generate_code

**Reasoning:** Testing hypotheses validates analysis and leads to actionable resolutions, ensuring the flow block is addressed effectively.

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** low
**Progress:** 100%
