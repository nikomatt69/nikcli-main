## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 1
- **File Modifications:** 4
- **External Calls:** 0

## Tasks

### 1. ‚ö°Ô∏é Map complete src/cli directory structure and dependencies üî¥

**Description:** Perform comprehensive exploration of src/cli folder to identify all files, modules, and their interdependencies. Create a dependency graph to understand the orchestration flow and identify circular dependencies or unused imports that could cause memory leaks.

**Tools:** explore_directory, read_file

**Reasoning:** Understanding the complete structure is essential before analyzing bottlenecks and memory leaks. This provides the foundation for identifying architectural issues.

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 15%

### 2. ‚è≥ Analyze CLI orchestration and service initialization flows üî¥

**Description:** Deep-dive into orchestrator service, planning service, and main CLI entry points. Trace execution paths from command invocation through service initialization to task completion. Identify synchronous blocking operations, promise chains without proper cleanup, and event listener accumulation.

**Tools:** read_file, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Orchestration flows are critical bottleneck points. Improper async handling, missing cleanup, or blocking operations directly cause performance issues and memory leaks.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 3. ‚è≥ Audit resource management and cleanup patterns üî¥

**Description:** Examine all file handles, stream operations, child processes, event listeners, and timer usage. Verify proper cleanup in finally blocks, error handlers, and process exit handlers. Check for missing .close(), .destroy(), or .removeListener() calls that cause memory leaks.

**Tools:** read_file, doc_search

**Reasoning:** Unclosed resources are the primary cause of memory leaks in Node.js applications. This systematic audit will identify concrete leak sources.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 4. ‚è≥ Profile TaskMaster AI and context system memory usage üî¥

**Description:** Analyze TaskMaster service, AI provider, and context system for large object retention, unbounded caches, and context accumulation. Check if contexts are properly cleared after task completion and if there are memory limits on cached data structures.

**Tools:** read_file, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** AI context and task management systems often accumulate large amounts of data. Without proper limits and cleanup, these become major memory leak sources.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 5. ‚è≥ Identify synchronous bottlenecks and I/O blocking operations üî¥

**Description:** Search for synchronous file operations (readFileSync, writeFileSync), CPU-intensive computations in main thread, and sequential operations that could be parallelized. Measure potential impact on CLI responsiveness and throughput.

**Tools:** read_file, execute_command

**Reasoning:** Synchronous operations block the event loop causing severe performance bottlenecks. Identifying these provides concrete optimization opportunities.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 6. ‚è≥ Analyze error handling and exception propagation paths üü°

**Description:** Trace error handling throughout the CLI codebase. Identify unhandled promise rejections, missing try-catch blocks, and error swallowing that could hide issues or leave resources in inconsistent states causing memory retention.

**Tools:** read_file, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Poor error handling leads to resource leaks and undefined behavior. Proper error paths ensure cleanup code executes even during failures.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 7. ‚è≥ Review agent coordination and inter-process communication üü°

**Description:** Examine how specialized agents communicate, share context, and coordinate execution. Check for message queue buildup, unbounded buffers, or missing backpressure mechanisms that cause memory growth under load.

**Tools:** read_file, doc_search

**Reasoning:** Agent orchestration involves complex communication patterns. Without proper flow control, message queues and shared state can grow unbounded.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 8. ‚è≥ Generate comprehensive code review report with evidence üî¥

**Description:** Compile all findings into a detailed report categorizing issues by severity (confirmed bottlenecks, confirmed memory leaks, potential issues). Include specific file locations, line numbers, code snippets, and concrete remediation recommendations with priority rankings.

**Tools:** write_file, generate_code

**Reasoning:** A structured report with evidence-based findings provides actionable insights. Concrete examples and line numbers ensure findings are verifiable and not approximations.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%
