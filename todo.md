## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 0
- **File Modifications:** 2
- **External Calls:** 0

## Tasks

### 1. âœ“ Workspace exploration and structure mapping ðŸ”´

**Description:** Use explore_directory to map the entire workspace structure, identify project type, tech stack, and key directories. Analyze package.json, configuration files, and overall architecture to understand the codebase foundation.

**Tools:** explore_directory, read_file

**Reasoning:** Understanding workspace structure is fundamental for targeted analysis and prevents missing critical components

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. âœ“ Deep project analysis with metrics ðŸ”´

**Description:** Execute analyze_project to generate comprehensive metrics including code quality, dependencies, security vulnerabilities, and architectural patterns. Include dependency analysis and performance indicators.

**Tools:** analyze_project, dependency_analysis

**Reasoning:** Objective metrics provide quantitative foundation for senior-level analysis and identify optimization opportunities

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 3. âœ“ Semantic code pattern analysis ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Use semantic_search to identify code patterns, architectural decisions, and implementation approaches across the codebase. Search for key concepts like authentication, data flow, error handling, and design patterns.

**Tools:** semantic_search, code_analysis

**Reasoning:** Pattern analysis reveals architectural consistency and development practices that metrics alone cannot capture

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 4. âœ“ Technology stack and documentation research ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Conduct comprehensive doc_search for identified technologies, frameworks, and patterns found in the codebase. Research best practices and compare against current implementation.

**Tools:** doc_search, web_search

**Reasoning:** External research provides academic context and industry standards for evaluating code quality and architecture

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 5. âœ“ Critical code quality analysis ðŸ”´

**Description:** Perform targeted code_analysis on core files identified in exploration phase. Focus on security, performance, and maintainability aspects with senior developer perspective.

**Tools:** code_analysis, read_file

**Reasoning:** Deep code analysis provides qualitative insights that complement automated metrics for comprehensive evaluation

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 6. âœ“ Generate comprehensive senior-level report ðŸ”´

**Description:** Synthesize all findings into a structured academic-quality report covering architecture analysis, code quality assessment, security review, performance optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations with implementation priorities.

**Tools:** write_file, generate_code

**Reasoning:** Final report consolidates all analysis into actionable intelligence that demonstrates senior-level understanding and provides clear improvement roadmap

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%
