# TaskMaster Plan: execute

execute

**Generated:** 9/26/2025, 7:06:59 PM
**Estimated Duration:** 110 minutes

## Tasks

1. ⏳ **Assess Execution Context**
   Analyze the current workspace and project structure to understand what 'execute' refers to, such as running a command, script, or build process. Use explore_directory to scan the directory and identify key files like package.json or main scripts.

2. ⏳ **Identify Target Command**
   Determine the specific command or process to execute based on project type (e.g., 'npm run start' for Node.js or 'python main.py' for scripts). If unclear, default to a standard run command after reading configuration files with read_file.

3. ⏳ **Prepare Execution Environment**
   Check dependencies, install missing packages if needed, and set up any required environment variables. Use analyze_project to scan for issues and manage_packages implicitly via commands.

4. ⏳ **Execute the Primary Command**
   Run the identified command using the execute_command tool with appropriate arguments, timeout, and autonomous mode enabled. Monitor for immediate outputs or errors.

5. ⏳ **Monitor and Log Execution Output**
   Capture logs, outputs, and any errors during execution. Write results to a temporary log file using write_file for review.

6. ⏳ **Validate Execution Results**
   Check if the execution succeeded by analyzing outputs, running basic tests if applicable (e.g., via generate_code for simple validation scripts), and confirming expected changes in files.

7. ⏳ **Document and Report Completion**
   Summarize the execution results, including any generated files or changes, and search docs if needed for post-execution best practices. Write a final report file.
