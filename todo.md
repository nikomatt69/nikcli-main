## Tasks

### 1. âœ“ Analyze current IDE context and workspace state ðŸ”´

**Description:** Gather comprehensive information about the current workspace, open files, recent changes, and project structure to understand what operation needs to be repeated. Examine git history, recent commands, and active development context.

**Tools:** ide_context, explore_directory

**Reasoning:** Understanding the current context is essential to determine what the user wants repeated - could be a previous command, operation, or task sequence

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. âœ“ Review recent execution history and patterns ðŸ”´

**Description:** Analyze the most recent operations, commands, and tasks that were executed in the current session. Identify the last significant action or task sequence that could be the target for repetition.

**Tools:** analyze_project, read_file

**Reasoning:** Identifying what to repeat requires examining recent activity patterns and execution history to find the most likely candidate operation

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

### 3. âœ“ Determine repetition target and scope ðŸ”´

**Description:** Based on context analysis, identify the specific operation, command, or task sequence to repeat. Validate that the target is safe and appropriate for repetition. Check for any dependencies or prerequisites.

**Tools:** analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Clear identification of what to repeat ensures accurate execution and prevents unintended operations

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

**Reasoning:** Proper preparation prevents errors and ensures the repeated operation can execute successfully in the current state

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

### 5. âœ“ Execute the repeated operation ðŸ”´

**Description:** Perform the identified operation again with the same or updated parameters. Monitor execution for any errors or differences from the original execution. Apply intelligent adaptations if context has changed.

**Tools:** execute_command, write_file, generate_code

**Reasoning:** This is the core action that fulfills the repeat request, executing the previously identified operation

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

### 6. âœ“ Validate repetition results ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Verify that the repeated operation completed successfully and produced expected results. Compare outcomes with previous execution if applicable. Check for any side effects or unexpected changes.

**Tools:** read_file, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Validation ensures the repetition was successful and helps identify any issues that need correction

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%
