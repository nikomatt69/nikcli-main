## Tasks

### 1. ‚è≥ Comprehensive Workspace Structure Analysis üî¥

**Description:** Execute a deep exploration of the entire workspace directory structure to identify all source files, dependencies, and architectural patterns. Map out project layout, identify entry points, and document the overall codebase organization. This forms the foundation for all subsequent analysis tasks.

**Estimated Duration:** 20 minutes

**Tools:** explore_directory, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Understanding the complete workspace structure is essential before analyzing for issues. This step identifies all code files, dependencies, and project patterns needed for targeted analysis.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

### 2. ‚è≥ Race Conditions & Concurrency Issues Detection üî¥

**Description:** Analyze all async/await patterns, promise chains, shared state management, event listeners, and concurrent operations. Search for: unprotected shared variables, race conditions in state updates, missing synchronization mechanisms, callback hell patterns, and improper error handling in async flows. Document specific file locations and code sections.

**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes

**Tools:** code_analysis, semantic_search, read_file

**Reasoning:** Race conditions cause unpredictable behavior and data corruption. Early detection prevents production issues and improves system reliability.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

### 3. ‚è≥ Performance Bottlenecks & Optimization Opportunities üî¥

**Description:** Identify performance bottlenecks including: inefficient algorithms (nested loops, O(n¬≤) operations), unoptimized database queries, missing caching mechanisms, redundant computations, large bundle sizes, and slow I/O operations. Analyze execution paths for N+1 query patterns and unnecessary re-renders. Generate profiling recommendations.

**Estimated Duration:** 35 minutes

**Tools:** code_analysis, dependency_analysis, semantic_search

**Reasoning:** Bottlenecks directly impact user experience and system scalability. Identifying and documenting them enables targeted optimization efforts.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

### 4. ‚è≥ Memory Leaks & Resource Management Analysis üî¥

**Description:** Scan for memory leak patterns: unreleased event listeners, unclosed file handles, uncleared timers/intervals, circular references, detached DOM nodes, and missing cleanup in lifecycle hooks. Check for accumulating data structures, unbounded caches, and improper garbage collection. Document each potential leak with severity assessment.

**Estimated Duration:** 25 minutes

**Tools:** code_analysis, semantic_search, read_file

**Reasoning:** Memory leaks cause performance degradation and eventual system crashes. Early detection prevents production incidents and improves long-term stability.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 5. ‚è≥ Logical Flow Errors & Code Quality Issues üî¥

**Description:** Identify logical errors including: unreachable code, missing null checks, incorrect conditional logic, type mismatches, improper error handling, missing validations, and edge case handling failures. Analyze control flow for dead code paths, infinite loops, and unhandled exceptions. Document each issue with impact assessment.

**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes

**Tools:** code_analysis, semantic_search, read_file

**Reasoning:** Logical errors cause functional bugs and unpredictable behavior. Systematic identification ensures code reliability and maintainability.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 6. ‚è≥ Temporary Code & Technical Debt Detection üü°

**Description:** Search for and catalog all TODO comments, FIXME markers, placeholder implementations, temporary workarounds, commented-out code, 'for now' patterns, mock data, stub functions, and incomplete features. Categorize by: urgency, affected modules, and recommended action. Create prioritized remediation list.

**Estimated Duration:** 20 minutes

**Tools:** semantic_search, execute_command, read_file

**Reasoning:** Technical debt accumulates and creates maintenance burden. Documenting temporary code enables strategic cleanup and prevents forgotten issues.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 7. ‚è≥ Dependency & Security Vulnerability Assessment üü°

**Description:** Analyze all project dependencies for outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, unused dependencies, and version conflicts. Check for supply chain risks and licensing issues. Identify optimization opportunities through dependency consolidation and tree-shaking possibilities.

**Estimated Duration:** 15 minutes

**Tools:** dependency_analysis, analyze_project

**Reasoning:** Vulnerable dependencies pose security risks. Assessment enables informed decisions about updates and dependency management.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 0%

---

### 8. ‚è≥ Generate Comprehensive Optimization Report üî¥

**Description:** Synthesize findings from all analysis tasks into a single structured report organized by: severity levels (critical/high/medium/low), impact categories (performance/security/reliability/maintainability), specific recommendations with implementation guidance, estimated effort for each fix, and prioritized action plan. Include before/after performance projections and ROI analysis.

**Estimated Duration:** 40 minutes

**Tools:** write_file, generate_code

**Reasoning:** A comprehensive report translates raw analysis into actionable intelligence, enabling strategic decision-making about optimization priorities and resource allocation.

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 0%
