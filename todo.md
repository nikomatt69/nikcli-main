## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk:** medium
- **Destructive Operations:** 1
- **File Modifications:** 3
- **External Calls:** 0

## Tasks

### 1. âœ“ Analyze current repository structure ðŸ”´

**Description:** Use analyze_project to get comprehensive overview of codebase including metrics, dependencies, and security scan. Also explore directory structure to understand project organization and identify potential issues.

**Tools:** analyze_project, explore_directory

**Reasoning:** Essential first step to understand current state before optimization

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 2. âœ“ Identify performance bottlenecks ðŸ”´

**Description:** Analyze code quality and patterns to find performance issues, code smells, and anti-patterns. Check for large files, complex functions, and inefficient algorithms that need optimization.

**Tools:** code_analysis, read_file

**Reasoning:** Directly addresses optimization needs by finding specific problem areas

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 3. âœ“ Review and optimize dependencies ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Run dependency analysis to check for outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, unused dependencies, and optimization opportunities. Suggest modern alternatives and remove bloat.

**Tools:** dependency_analysis

**Reasoning:** Dependencies significantly impact performance and security - optimization here yields major benefits

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 4. âœ“ Analyze Git workflow and repository health ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Check commit patterns, branching strategy, and repository size. Identify large files in git history, suggest .gitignore improvements, and optimize repository structure for better collaboration.

**Tools:** git_workflow, execute_command

**Reasoning:** Repository optimization includes both code and version control efficiency

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** medium
**Progress:** 100%

---

### 5. âœ“ Generate optimization recommendations report ðŸ”´

**Description:** Compile all findings into actionable optimization plan with specific file changes, dependency updates, and architectural improvements. Include priority levels and implementation steps.

**Tools:** write_file, doc_search

**Reasoning:** Creates deliverable that user can act upon - transforms analysis into concrete optimization roadmap

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** high
**Progress:** 100%
