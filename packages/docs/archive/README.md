## Archived Files

### CLI Reference (Archived January 2025)

The following CLI reference files have been replaced with accurate documentation based on the actual CLI implementation:

- **agent-management.mdx** → Replaced by [agent-commands.mdx](/cli-reference/agent-commands)
- **mcp-protocol.mdx** → Content integrated into main documentation
- **mode-control.mdx** → Content integrated into [commands-overview.mdx](/cli-reference/commands-overview)
- **project-ops.mdx** → Content integrated into [terminal-ops.mdx](/cli-reference/terminal-ops)

## Why These Were Archived

1. **Source Code Analysis**: Direct examination of the CLI command implementations
2. **Accurate Command Inventory**: Complete enumeration of all 144 actual slash commands
3. **Real Examples**: Working examples verified against the actual CLI
4. **Enterprise Standards**: Professional documentation suitable for enterprise use

## New CLI Documentation Structure

The current CLI documentation provides comprehensive coverage of:

- **144 Slash Commands**: Complete reference for all interactive commands
- **nikctl Commands**: Background agent management
- **nikd Commands**: Daemon management and configuration
- **Real Examples**: Copy-pasteable examples that actually work
